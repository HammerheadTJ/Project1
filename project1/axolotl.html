Axolotls or their scientific name <strong><i>"Ambystoma mexicanum"</i></strong> are large salamanders that come from the remnants of lake Xochimilco and Chaloc in Mexico City, Mexico.
The thing that sets Axolotls away from other salamanders is that they are fully aquatic. They can reach up to 10 inches in total length and live up to 10-15 years if cared for correctly. They are like other amphibians in the sense that they do not require a light. Axolotls eat nightcrawlers (large earthworms), bloodworms, cooked shrimp, and there are even sinking pellets that you can provide for them.
Axolotls like their water to be cold, between 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit and they can become stressed if the water is any warmer than 65 degrees. Over all, if you are able to keep the right temps and feed a stable diet, an Axolotl may be the right pet for you!
