<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h1><img src="images/sidon.jpg" width="400" height="300"></h1>
<p>You have swam your way into <i>Neptune's Playground,</i> the newest place to come and buy exotic pets! We are starting to specialize in <a href="betta.html">Betta Fish</a> and <a href="axolotl.html">Axolotls</a> but hope to expand to differnt species of fish and marine life until our page is full of many unique aquatic pets.
 We hope to provide the best customer service that we can when it comes to purchasing one of our animals. There are two different ways you can purchase an animal. Those two options are Buy Now, and Bidding. Buy now will be on a first come, first serve basis and bidding will have a starting price
 and the price should be increased by at lease $1.00 until the bidding is closed.  <br>

 <h3>Buy Now:</h3>
Most of the animals for sale on our site will have a Buy Now price. With Buy Now you can purchase the selected fish without having to deal with bidding. But once a fish is purchased here, no one else has a chance to buy it. Check often or it may cause you to risk missing your dream fish!
<h3>Bidding:</h3>
Sometimes when we get a very special animal it will come to our site with a Bidding option that will be open for a total of 7 days. During this time anyone is able to place a bid on the animal as long as their bet is at least $1.00 more than the bid before it. After the 7 days the person with the highest bid will get an email that they won and will have 24 hours to pay for their animal before it goes back on the site.
Failure to pay for a won bid will result in being banned from purchasing a fish from the store.
<h3>Shipping:</h3>
Shipping is sold seperatly from each purchase but when buying multiple you can choose to put them into the same shipping box. Shipping usually takes 2-3 days to arrive once they are sent out and costs $20 dollars.
