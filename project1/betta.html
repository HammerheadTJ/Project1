<strong>Betta fish,</strong> also known as Siamese or Japanese fighting fish, are probably one of the most common fish sold in stores. While these beautiful fish are kept in stores in tiny little jars of water,
it is recommended that they are housed in no smaller than a 2.5 Gallon tank with a filter and a heater. Betta fish are Omnivores and in the wild they would eat insects such as crickets, flies, grasshoppers, and insect larva. Their food is typically found on the surface of water.
 Another interesting thing about Bettas is that they come in many different tail types and color variants. Something unique about bettas is that they also breathe air through a special organ they have called the <i>labyrinth organ</i>. This allows them to survive in water with low-oxygen content. Like the name says, they are called fighting fish for a reason and are very territorial. It is not recommended that you put more than one male in a single tank at any time. Sometimes
multiple female bettas in a tank can be done and it is called a Betta "sorority" but it is still not recommended.
